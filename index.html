            <P>I am a Mechanical and Eletrical engineer that decide to go into web development to get on board of Industry 4.0.
            Industry 4.0 will change (or it is changing now) how we interact with the manufacturing enviroments and being a web development will be the new language that engineers will need to "talk" to be able to survive on this new enviroment.
         </P>
         <p>I have a lot of interest on how the technology is changing our work places. The application of web development in 
             the manufacturing enviroments is tremendous and we need to be prepare for them. Productivity increases will come from
             the interaction from the manufacturing and the web development. Quality responsivness has unlimited possibilities with
             everything that can be created. 
         </p>
         <p>My favorite thing is to play soccer and to watch every sports that is show on TV. I like to hang out with friends. 
             I am a fanatic of good movies.I like to dance and to have a good time with my friends. On the picture below you can 
             see me on the dance floor with the guy I have the most fun, my son.
